This is our first weekly development blog. The "48" here means the 48th week of 2020.

This week, most of the team's focus was on learning unity, since none of us are familiar with it yet. Unity is used to build the project's avatar display front-end.

During the learning process, Tingmao built a simple game:

We also dived into the project's existsing unity code and learned about how it currently works.
