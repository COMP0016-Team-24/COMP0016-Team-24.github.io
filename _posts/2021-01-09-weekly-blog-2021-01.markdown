## Supporting vertical screens

Our client just told us that the assistent needs to be able to run on vertical screens, and preferably support screen-rotation on the go. As such, I have re-made some of the video player animation and make them adopt to screen aspect ratio.

## Victoria: Modifying the plane texture and 'clear' skybox

The original project used a Unity-chan material for the plane (floor) which was quite uninteresting so I decided to modify the material to a texture from a [free grass texture pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/grass-flowers-pack-free-138810). I also changed the clear skybox to a slightly nicer looking one, also from AllSky. Both changes are shown in the image below:
