## Tingmao: Supporting vertical screens

Our client just told us that the assistant needs to be able to run on vertical screens, and preferably support screen-rotation on the go. As such, I have re-made some of the video player animation and make them adopt to screen aspect ratio.

## Victoria: Modifying the plane texture and 'clear' skybox

The original project used a Unity-chan material for the plane (floor) which was quite uninteresting so I decided to modify the material to a texture from a [free grass texture pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/grass-flowers-pack-free-138810). I also changed the clear skybox to a slightly nicer looking one, also from AllSky. Both changes are shown in the image below:

## Kaloyan: Edit when will the menu bubbles appear

After seeing the menu bubbles our client suggested that it would be much better if the bubbles only appear when neither the assistant nor a user has talked for some time. So I implemented this change with a waiting time of 30 seconds for someone to say something.
