We have finished all the coding for this project, and the git repository is not expected to change anymore.

We would spend the rest of the time before the final deadline on website, dev-blog and presentation preparation.

I would like to thank all team member for the work dedicated into this difficult project.

## Client setup meeting

This week we met for one last time with our client to guide them through the setup process. We mostly expected the user manual to be self-explanatory and we did not offer too much assistant. This ensures that future users of this project can also complete the setup without help from us.

We did not complete everything, because the MinGW pacman install took too long. However the client has not gotten back to us with problems, so presumably the setup went well.
