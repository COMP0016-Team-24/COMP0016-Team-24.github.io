## Tingmao: investigated how current lip-sync works

The lip sync made by Brandon is actually quite simple - about every 100ms (depending on the sound being made), it tells the animator to do a cross-fade between the existing state and a new state that corrosponds to the required lip shape. The unity-chan asset we are using already has all these mouse-shape states set up (MTH_A, MTH_E, etc.), and they basically just control a bunch of weights for the face skin's shape keys.

Since we need our avatar to support other models, those models either needs to already has those shape-keys, or one of us would have to model these shapes by deforming the mouth. The current model is extremely well-made with very accurate mouth-shapes as well as gemoetry for the inner mouth, but my guess is that, at least for an anime style avatar, simply making the inner mouth a red background and making the mouth "hole" the correct shape would be enough for this project.

We are still to find any suitable models.
