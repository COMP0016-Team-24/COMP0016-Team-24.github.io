## Tingmao: Easier setup part 1 - Skill server

One of our requirement is to "simplify the setup process". Currently in order to get the skill server running user has to do a lot of work manually, including installing python dependencies and getting a certificate from Let's Encrypt. I have wrote a set-up script and a `Dockerfile` that does all of the above, and now user just need to run `./configure.sh <their-domain>` and `./start.sh` in any new debian VM to get the skill server running.
