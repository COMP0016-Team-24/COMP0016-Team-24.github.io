## `.gitignore` for Unity

Currently all the cache files produced by Unity are tracked by git, because we did not have a proper `.gitignore` file for Unity. This resulted in thousands of changes seen in `git status` and the vscode git panel, and if developers blindly commit everything this could easily led to merge conflicts, which is undesirable. Hence, we downloaded the GitHub's [official gitignore file for Unity](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore). We also did a `git ls-files -i --exclude-standard | xargs git rm --cached` to remove all the existing committed garbage files.
